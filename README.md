# Assignement-4
In my object oriented java class we had an assignment where we had to define objects in classes such that they were structured in
hierarchical manner, so there were parent and child classes. 

The objects that we had to define were: Wooden Screws, Carriage Bolts, Threaded Bolts, Common Nails, 
                                        Inner Thread, Wing Nut, Screw, Outter Thread, and a Bolt. 
                                        
For example, Carriage & Threaded Bolts were a child class of the Bolt class.
